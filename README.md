# Markdown Metadata Automation in Julia

## üìå Overview

This Julia package automates the process of adding, modifying, and managing metadata in Markdown files. It supports multiple metadata formats, including YAML, JSON, TOML, and LaTeX, making it a powerful tool for content management, documentation, and research writing.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Multi-format Support**: Automatically detect and modify metadata in YAML, JSON, and TOML front matter.
- **LaTeX Metadata Handling**: Convert Markdown metadata into LaTeX-compatible fields (`\title{}`, `\author{}`, `\date{}`).
- **Batch Processing**: Apply metadata updates across multiple Markdown files.
- **Format Conversion**: Convert metadata between YAML, JSON, and TOML.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: Automate metadata modifications using simple commands.
- **Integration with Static Site Generators**: Compatible with Jekyll, Hugo, MkDocs, and other Markdown-based platforms.
- **Search & Filtering**: Find Markdown files based on metadata (e.g., `date > 2024-01-01`).

## üéØ Use Cases

### **1. Static Site Generators (SSGs)**

Platforms like **Jekyll, Hugo, and Eleventy** rely on front matter metadata. This package automates metadata updates, ensuring consistency across blog posts, documentation, and portfolios.

#### Example:

- Automatically update `last_updated` timestamps.
- Convert metadata formats when migrating between site generators.

### **2. Academic & Research Writing**

Researchers using **Markdown for notes** and **LaTeX for papers** can easily transfer metadata between the two formats.

#### Example:

- Convert Markdown front matter into LaTeX title and author fields.
- Organize academic notes by automatically tagging and categorizing them.

### **3. Data Journalism & Knowledge Management**

Structured metadata helps journalists and researchers manage large collections of Markdown files efficiently.

#### Example:

- Tag Markdown files with categories (`category: "AI ethics"`) and filter them easily.
- Generate summaries based on metadata fields.

### **4. Developers & API Documentation**

Developers maintaining **Markdown-based documentation** can automate metadata management for better organization and searchability.

#### Example:

- Bulk edit metadata for multiple API documentation files.
- Use metadata for version control and history tracking.

### **5. AI & NLP Applications**

Metadata can be used for **text processing, categorization, and AI-based document retrieval**.

#### Example:

- AI-driven search that filters Markdown notes based on metadata tags.
- Automate content classification for machine learning applications.

## üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps

- Implement metadata parsing and modification functions.
- Develop a CLI tool for batch metadata operations.
- Add compatibility with more document processing tools like Pandoc.
