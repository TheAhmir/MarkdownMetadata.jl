# What We're Doing Here

To be blunt, job search has been an ABSOLUTE PAIN. My original thought was getting a degree in CS would get me an internship and eventually lead to a nice well paying full-time job... I was wrong. I made this blog to aid in my performance as an applicant and coder.

Let me just vent first.

## Where am I now?

- Earned my bachelor's double majoring in computer science and data science
- Dozens of projects primarily in web development, but including mobile development and data analytics (albeit utilizing ChatGPT frugally)
- Various networking attempts. A couple recommendations and advice from various people, bearing no fruit
  - AKA no professional experience, internship or otherwise
- Created my portfolio website
- Adjusted and improved my resume consistently (Ofc I have specified resume's depending on the type of role)
- Earned Google's Advanced Data Analytics Certificate
- Over 350 applications in the last 4 months
- Currently enrolled in an MSBA program
- [Placeholder for something I might be missing]

Ok, I'll be the first to say my credentials don't necessarily mean the most. Getting through college is basically a checkbox filler that doesn't guarantee an individual has the required skillset. What's more, I didn't really start grinding for an internship until the summer of my junior year. Since then, I have been applying to various jobs rather consistently and have been unsuccessful at every turn.

Although I stated that my credentials don't guarantee anything, I do believe that they should have been enough to get some low paying internship by now and I don't I don't by any means feel that I am not capable of doing the jobs I'm applying for: data analyst and software engineer roles. To offset my lack of experience, I've continuously worked on various projects and dappled, with a little AI help, in many areas: Swift, React Native, Flutter, Full-Stack, React, Angular, Vuejs (what this site is written in), SQL, NoSQL, Natural Language Processing, Web Scraping, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data manipulation, etc. Although I wouldn't say I'm an expert in any of these, I think I know enough to get started in any of these areas and begin working through any issues.

Yet, I still haven't been successful in my job search.

## What I'm Doing From Here

Now, what am I doing to get a job? I recently had the opportunity to be invited to a few coding assessments... I failed... all of them. What these projects don't teach you is how to think around the "3sum" coding assessment question and develop an answer that in computationally efficient. What's worse is that I recognized some of the problems, but couldn't remember the line of thought need to complete them successfully. If I had been able to flow through these problems, I might be where I want to be right now. That is what this blog is intended for: helping me work through and understand coding problems to potential ease through assessments or at least have a better understanding of the thought process to complete a problem I haven't seen.

## My Aim

Through this blog I want to grow as a problem solver and programmer. I also want to have some fun, so I am planning to dabble in different programming languages, however, one thing I want to be included in every post is my thoughts going into a problem, how I went about finding the right answer if my original thought was wrong, and my interpretation and thought process of the correct answer. I want to articulate the results in a way I and readers can understand. Hopefully, this all results in my improving in leetcode and in thinking.
